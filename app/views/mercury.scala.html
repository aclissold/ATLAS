@main("Mercury", "Nobody") {

The smallest planet in our corner of the galaxy offers BIG fun!
Come and take a day trip ...or a 58 day trip! That's how many Earth days it would take to experience a full rotation on Mercury.
There's plenty to do- spend some time exploring the thousands of craters on the planet's surface, or hiking the Mercurian plains.
