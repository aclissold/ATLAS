@main("Mercury") {

The smallest planet in our corner of the galaxy offers BIG fun!
Come and take a day trip…or a 58-day trip! That's how many Earth days it would take to experience a full rotation on Mercury.
There's plenty to do—spend some time exploring the thousands of craters on the planet's surface, or hike the Mercurian plains.
