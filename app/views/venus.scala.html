Visit Earth's sister planet! While Venus is almost the same size as Earth, it boasts a completely different atmosphere. In fact, it has the densest atmosphere among terrestrial planets! Make sure to pack your shorts because this planet is hotâ€”735 K, to be exact. Geology enthusiasts can enjoy the over-150 volcanoes this planet has to offer.
